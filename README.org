** Basic Setup
#+BEGIN_SRC lua
-- initializes all defaults
require("plover_viewer").setup({
	builtin = {
		cwd = "path/to/your/config"
}})
-- some possible locations of where config could be depending on OS
-- cwd = {"~/.config/plover/", "/mnt/c/Users/yourName/AppData/Local/plover/plover/"},

-- default key bindings (disabled by default)
-- view clippy.txt in terminal buffer
vim.keymap.set('n', '<leader>pv', function () require("plover_viewer.builtin").view() end)
-- split the current buffer and view clippy.txt in the terminal (togglable)
vim.keymap.set('n', '<leader>ps', function () require("plover_viewer.builtin").splitToggle() end)
-- view tapey_tape.txt in terminal
vim.keymap.set('n', '<leader>pt', function () require("plover_viewer.builtin").view({file_name = "tapey_tape.txt"}) end)
#+END_SRC
** Custom Setup 
- Below is the default setup for this plugin 
	- you only have to override the parts that you want to change	 
#+BEGIN_SRC lua
require("plover_viewer").setup({
builtin = {
	viewer = {
		choose = "terminal", -- or buf
		buf = {
		},
		terminal = {
			type = "term", -- or "tmux"
			number = 6,
			command = "tail",
			command_args = {"-f"},
		},
	},
	split = {
		choose = "horizontal", -- or vertical
		horizontal = {
			size = 10,
		},
		vertical = {
			size = nil,
		}
	},
	file_name = "clippy.txt",
	cwd = nil
},
disable_default_mappings = true
)}
#+END_SRC
*** builtin
- file\under{}name = "clippy.txt"
	- the file to live view
- cwd = nil
	- str: location of config files
**** viewer
- choose = "terminal"
	- "terminal": use the terminal for live viewing
	- "buf": use a vim buffer for live viewing
- terminal.type = "term"
	- "term": use an neovim terminal
	- "tmux": use tmux terminal (note that splits for tmux are not supported yet)
- terminal.number = "6"
	- number: unique number assigned to a terminal
- terminal.command = "tail"
	- str: command to run in the terminal
- terminal.command\under{}args = {"-f"}
	- table[str]: command arguments to run in the terminal
**** split
- choose = "horizontal"
	- "horizontal": open split horizontally
	- "vertical": open split vertically
- horizontal.size = 10
	- height as in the number of rows (only for horizontal split)
	- set to nil for a normal split
- vertical.size = nil
	- width as in the number of columns (only for vertical split)
	- set to nil for a normal split
** Custom Mappings
- you can override the opts given previously to setup() in your keymaps
	- for example if you wanted a vertical split instead of horizontal:
#+BEGIN_SRC lua
vim.keymap.set('n', '<leader>pw', function ()
	require("plover_viewer.builtin").splitToggle({
		split = {
			choose = "vertical"
		}})
end)
#+END_SRC
** Contributing
- feel free to raise issues or chuck a pull request if anything is unclear or doesn't work
	- I would be happy to receive any feedback
** Acknowledgements
- I would like to thank:
	- Rabbitgrowth: for telling me about tail -f, without them this plugin would not have been made
